# BT4012_AML-Fraud-Detection

In the wake of rapid technological advancements, the banking industry has undergone significant digital transformation. This evolution has notably led to the decentralisation of financial transactions, transitioning traditional currencies into digital forms. With this shift, however, comes an increased vulnerability to digital attacks such as fraud, anomalies, and privacy breaches. The financial sector, in particular, faces escalating challenges due to the rise in transaction volumes, leading to substantial economic losses globally. Anomalies in this context represent any suspicious network activity that deviates from the norm, critical in cybersecurity and digital financial exchange for detecting fraud and network intrusions. 

The emergence of blockchain technology introduced a secure, decentralized ledger system, addressing many security issues of centralized systems. However, this technology, especially within the Ethereum network, still faces challenges from malicious activities like phishing scams. These scams pose a significant threat to the security and integrity of digital transactions, leading to considerable economic damages. 

This research aims to address these challenges by leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, specifically XGBoost and Random Forest, to detect and classify phishing accounts within the Ethereum blockchain. This approach represents a novel application of machine learning in analyzing blockchain transaction data, with a focus on enhancing the security and integrity of digital currencies. Our work contributes to the field by integrating these models directly into the blockchain, using a smart contract system for real-time classification of transactions as malicious or legitimate, and implementing attacker models to bolster the system's resilience against blockchain-specific threats.
